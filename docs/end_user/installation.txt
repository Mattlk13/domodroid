============
Installation
============
You need to allow unknown source

Just copy/paste the apk you've just download

Open it from your device and install it.

If you want to use map view, you need to put your map image (png or svg format) in domodroid directory.
If this directory doesn't exist Domodroid will create it at first launch so that you will find it easily next time.
